# The ML5 Situation
If you've looked this far into my GitHub profile, congrats. You're dedicated to putting a halt to the power of our schools, and the invasive measures they take to stop us from having fun. You're so dedicated you looked into an obscure, random JavaScript learning repository to find your answers. Well.. here it is.

On 10/28/2024 at 9:20 AM, MathLesson5's repository was privated for a second time. This README will explain the entire situation.
## Chapter 1: Exploring Developer Mode 
[10/25, Friday] I was screwing around with my friend at lunch when I dared him to turn on developer mode. We believed this would unblock everything.. however, he didn't know it would wipe his chromebook. In fairness, I tried to warn him, but he clicked [Confirm] twice anyway. Spoiler, it didn't work, and I was scared that I had bricked his chromebook (he could no longer access the school wifi)
However, this interested me, and later that afternoon, I did more research on unblockers.
## Chapter 2: Discovering ExtHang3r
[10/25, later in the day] I was on a call with a different friend. We were laughing and slightly terrified about what I'd done to the other friend's chromebook. As a joke, I looked up "how to unblock every website on my school chromebook" The results.. shocked me.
I found a 2 minute long YouTube video, on, surprise, how to do just that. I didn't think it would work, and just thought it would end up like the KillSecurly situation that nearly bricked my chromebook. However, the description said it was unpatched on all unblocker Chrome extensions and new Chrome versions, so I decided to give it a shot. This exploit works a little bit differently, it freezes your chromebook for a few minutes before working. Of course, I was terrified it bricked my chromebook, but to my surprise, it worked. I went to Netquel to see, and for the first time in months, a student at my school was able to play Netquel on their chromebook.
## Chapter 3: Sharing the Exploit
[10/26, Saturday] I was writing an essay, and.. I was pretty bored. I was doing some random stuff on my chromebook, such as watching Block's ToSF stream (gg bro) Just because I could, and because I was really procrastinating here, I decided to push v1.1.4 on MathLesson5, even though I was already working on a big update. I think my reasoning here was that the exploit would get patched soon, whatever, I have no clue what I was thinking in that moment. This would mark an end of an era for unblockers at my school, yay! So fun! Hell yeah!
[10/28, Monday] In my homeroom class, for SOME REASON I decided to show my friend with the wiped chromebook the ExtHang3r exploit, probably because I felt bad for bro idrk. And uh..

he shared it with everyone.
Everyone in this homeroom class knew what I'd discovered, except potentially our teacher.

at this point I'm like fucking panicking because idk what to do if the ENTIRE school finds ChromeOS's deadliest exploit, so I say screw it and private ML5 after almost a month of keeping it public.
## Chapter 4: The Future of ML5
"Will ML5 come back?? I wanna play my games omg im so bored" yeh that's what you are all thinking right now. And hopefully.. the answer is yes!

It won't be soon, if it ever does come back. If so, it will come with the release of v1.2.0, and likely the removal of ExtHang3r. If people find out about this, I am just cooked.

Thank you all for the support and motivation (like 2 of you) and helping me make this repository (probably 1 of you)

This situation climaxed with my homeroom teacher finding the ML6 slideshow and us having to migrate. All and all, this situation was hell, but it will be over soon.

Goodbye! MathTeacher5, out.
